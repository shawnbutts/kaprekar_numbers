# kaprekar_numbers

Inspired by https://github.com/gekitsuu/kaprekar_numbers, I wrote this to generate Kaprekar numbers and play with go. 

To understand what these are please see the wikipedia article located http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Kaprekar#Kaprekar_number

Set `concurrency` to the number of go routines you want.
